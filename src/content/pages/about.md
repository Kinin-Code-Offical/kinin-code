# About

I build projects at the intersection of electronics and software. My focus is on clean interfaces, stable systems, and fast prototyping that turns ideas into working products.

## Currently
- Studying Electrical & Electronics Engineering
- Building full-stack interfaces for hardware-driven systems
- Exploring interactive 3D and terminal-driven UX
