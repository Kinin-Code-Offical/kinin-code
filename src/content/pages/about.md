# About

Hi, I'm **Yamaç Gürsel**. I'm an Electric & Electronics Engineering student who builds projects at the intersection of electronics and software.

Since an early age, I've been fascinated by creating things at the intersection of electronics and software. Starting from my first Arduino project, I've evolved to work across the entire stack—from interactive 3D experiences and full-stack applications to kernel-level development and embedded systems. I see every project as a learning opportunity and enjoy pushing the boundaries of what's possible with technology.

## My Journey

During my electric and electronics education, I discovered the importance of turning theoretical knowledge into practical applications. I've gained experience across diverse fields including web development, 3D modeling, artificial intelligence, and IoT, which has helped me develop an interdisciplinary perspective. Each domain has given me the ability to approach problems from different angles.

My goal is to create products that prioritize user experience while maintaining technical excellence through rapid prototyping. I believe in minimalist design philosophy and strive to make complex systems simple and understandable.
